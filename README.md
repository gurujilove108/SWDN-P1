Senior Web Developer Nanodegree Project 1

1. git clone or download this file and then cd into it
2. run dev_appserver.py . or dev_appserver.py app.yaml in the root directory of the github repo to see the development version
3. or if you want to be cooler you can see it running online at https://eventsandppl.appspot.com 
4. the first page you see is the events.html. this page loads all the events from the db.
5. next step is to create an event and then see it show up on the events page. then make an account and login. the login
6. doesnt actually have all the necessary login functionality but it will tell you if your username exists.
7. if you dont already have a node_modules package then download then npm install gulp and npm install browser-sync
8. when thats installed you can run gulp in the root directory because thats where the gulpfile.js is and it will run the default task
9. the default task will watch for file changes and reload when those files are saved. make sure you run dev_appserver.py app.yaml before running gulp
10. Enjoy!
